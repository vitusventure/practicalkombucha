Think very hop forward beers like IPAs. This is in contrast to traditional hop additions to beer during boiling which add a large chunk of bitterness (this is useful to offset the very sweet wort).\nI have found hops to be a delightful addition to kombucha. The floral characteristics really compliment kombucha\u0026rsquo;s sourness and pair well with berry flavorings.\nProcedure # After 1f, transfer raw kombucha to be dry hopped to a fermenter. Add loose pellet hops of your chosen variety. I have used 1oz hops/1 gallon kombucha with great success, though that variable is ripe for experimentation.\nLet the hops soak in the kombucha 2-3 days.

It is the rubbery disk that develops during fermentation. Some are adamant that it must be kept from batch to batch, going so far as to wash and cut it down.\nThe biofilm is created by the bacteria in the kombucha as a defense mechanism against harsh environments. It is very pure cellulose which scaffolds together bacteria and yeast, providing a physical barrier to the outside world. In the wild, this would protect the bacteria from harsh environmental changes such as temperature swings or harmful UV light.\nWhen fermenting in our controlled environments the protective value of the biofilm is less meaningful. We keep the fermenter out of the light and keep it at a temperature the bacteria like. The fermenter is covered by a cloth from direct access, preventing bugs or other airborne baddies from invading the culture.\nWhy keep it? # It is an undeniable fact that the biofilm is chock full of the good microbes that make kombucha what it is. It is literally bacteria and yeast glued together into a solid mass. If you choose to keep the biofilm between batches it will absolutely contribute more microbes to your next batch.\nHowever, the liquid is quite plentiful in these microbes as well. This is where the probiotic benefits claimed by kombucha originate. So while the biofilm will mean more microbes starting your new batch, the liquid has enough already to jump start a healthy fermentation.\nWhat to do? # In the end, like so many things in life, it is up to you! I usually throw out the biofilm between batches simply because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend any energy keeping track of it. I have had great success brewing without the biofilm.\nIf you like the mystery of that strange disk floating in the jar or if you want to give your batch the absolute best environment to start your next batch, go ahead and toss that thing in. However, the ratio of starter to tea is probably the best way to hedge the bet in your favor if you are nervous about keeping your culture going.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/docs/opinions/terms/","title":"Terminology","section":"Opinions","content":" Terminology # Why be specific # Kombucha brewing has a great deal of associated mythology. While this provides some interesting reading and makes the brewing process feel magical, it can sometimes make it difficult for new brewers to understand what they are reading online (at least it did for me).\nWritten communication only really works if we all understand what specific terms mean. This is doubly true for something like a recipe, since the writer is attempting to convey specific instructions. To make things clear at least on this site, I will summarize the terms I intend to use. I don\u0026rsquo;t make any claim that these are the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; terms but they are the ones that make the most sense to me, and I will try to be consistent.\nTerms in use # Starter Liquid or Raw Kombucha # Unflavored, unpasteurized kombucha that has finished primary fermentation. This should be quite acidic and can be used to start the fermentation process in a new batch. This only refers to liquid.\nBiofilm # The cellulose layer that forms on top of fermenting Kombucha. This is sometimes referred to as a pellicle or SCOBY. But for clarity, I will use the narrowest term possible (biofilm). You can read more about biofilms on wikipedia. This only refers to the solid cellulose layer.\nMicrobes # The bacteria and yeast in kombucha that cause fermentation and the creation of its unique flavor. These different microorganisms work together to create kombucha. In general, the yeast eat sugar to create CO2 and alcohol. The bacterial oxidize the alcohol to create different acids, resulting it kombucha\u0026rsquo;s signature tang. This term refers to both types of microorganisms and is similar to SCOBY, but without all the history that term holds in kombucha culture.\n1f # First stage of fermentation. This is the primary fermentation where the starter liquid transforms sweet tea into raw kombucha. 1f requires oxygen for the bacteria to oxidize the alcohol, so the fermentation vessel is open to the air (with a tight fitting, close knit cover to keep insects and debris out).\n1.5f # An optional stage sometimes used to infuse additional flavors between the primary fermentation and bottling. This is usually carried out similar to 1f, but with some addition made directly to the raw kombucha.\n2f # Second stage of fermentation. This is the fermentation responsible for carbonation in bottles. After 1f, the raw kombucha is bottled with an additional sugar source (usually some type of fruit or berry). This additional sugar is a food source for the yeast. As the yeast consume the sugar, CO2 and alcohol are created. The sealed bottle contains the CO2 leading to carbonation.\nTerms I will not use # Pellicle # This is a term commonly used to refer to the biofilm. It is somewhat specific, but does have other meanings in more scientific communities. I personally like biofilm because it seems easier to recognize when looking in the jar.\nSCOBY # Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast. This term came into use in the late 1990s and is very overloaded in the Kombucha community. Some insist it refers only to the biofilm, others only to the starter liquid, some to both. To avoid this confusion, I will eschew its use entirely in favor of the more specific terms above.\n"}]
