Took out for 1 more day and got good fizz. Dry hopping:\nDry hopped 1/2 gallon in a large mason jar with .5oz Cashmere hops Hops in pellet form, added loose Let dry hop 3 days, then bottled with 2tbsp/16oz Triple Berry Simple Syrup Let carbonate 3 days Tasting notes # The non-dry hopped kombucha came out great. Ended up a bit less tart than I usually like, but that may be a result of slightly slower fermentation due to old starter.\nThe dry hopped kombucha was excellent. Slightly floral without being overpowering, the hops added a nice taste. Certainly will try again!\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/kombucha_recipes/base-kombucha-recipe/","title":"Base Kombucha Recipe","section":"Kombucha Recipes","content":" Base Kombucha Recipe # This is a very basic Kombucha recipe using easy to find ingredients. It should yield 1 gallon of finished Kombucha.\nSince you must retain 2 cups to start your next batch you will end with 14 cups finished Kombucha for bottling (or about 7 16oz bottles).\nIngredients # 2 cups Kombucha starter 4 cups sweet tea (see below) 10 cups cold water Procedures # 1. Make sweet tea # In a sauce pan, bring 4 cups water to a boil. Remove from heat, let cool until no longer boiling (1-2 min) Add 6 Lipton (or any black tea) bags, let steep 6 minutes Remove tea bags, mix in 1 cup sugar until dissolved 4 cups sweet tea are now finished 2. Prepare fermenter # Wash a 1 gallon fermenter well with soap and hot water. Consider spraying with diluted StarSan solution for sanitization.\n3. Mix Kombucha # Add 10 cups cold water to fermenter Add 4 cups sweet tea to fermenter Ensure diluted tea in fermenter is not too hot (I usually shoot for below 85 degrees) Add 2 cups starter liquid 4. Ferment # Place tight woven cloth cover over fermentor opening, secure with rubber band. This will allow air exchange, but will keep flies out Place in a warm area or supply supplimental heat with a heat pad (generally shoot to ferment around 75-82 degrees F) Allow to ferment until finished (about 7-10 days) Starting your next batch # Once fermentation is complete, reserve 2 cups of fermented kombucha as your starter for your next batch. Bottle the remaining fermented kombucha with flavoring.\nYou may discard the pellicle (or retain it if you want).

This will mean your batch is slightly over one gallon so be sure your fermenter is big enough! This will allow you to bottle a full gallon at the end of the batch and still have 2 cups left over to start your next batch.\nIf you are concerned about the strength of your starter you may want to avoid this variation. Adding some extra water will mean your ratio of starter is slightly lower.

While this provides some interesting reading and makes the brewing process feel magical, it can sometimes make it difficult for new brewers to understand what they are reading online (at least it did for me).\nWritten communication only really works if we all understand what specific terms mean. This is doubly true for something like a recipe, since the writer is attempting to convey specific instructions. To make things clear at least on this site, I will summarize the terms I intend to use. I don\u0026rsquo;t make any claim that these are the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; terms but they are the ones that make the most sense to me, and I will try to be consistent.\nTerms in use # Starter Liquid or Raw Kombucha Unflavored, unpasteurized kombucha that has finished primary fermentation. This should be quite acidic and can be used to start the fermentation process in a new batch. This only refers to liquid. Biofilm The cellulose layer that forms on top of fermenting Kombucha. This is sometimes referred to as a pellicle or SCOBY. But for clarity, I will use the narrowest term possible (biofilm). You can read more about biofilms on wikipedia. This only refers to the solid cellulose layer. Microbes The bacteria and yeast in kombucha that cause fermentation and the creation of its unique flavor. These different microorganisms work together to create kombucha. In general, the yeast eat sugar to create CO2 and alcohol. The bacterial oxidize the alcohol to create different acids, resulting it kombucha\u0026rsquo;s signature tang. This term refers to both types of microorganisms and is similar to SCOBY, but without all the history that term holds in kombucha culture. Terms I will not use # Pellicle This is a term commonly used to refer to the biofilm. It is somewhat specific, but does have other meanings in more scientific communities. SCOBY Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast. This term came into use in the late 1990s and is very overloaded in the Kombucha community. Some insist it refers only to the biofilm, others only to the starter liquid, some to both. To avoid this confusion, I will eschew its use entirely in favor of the more specific terms above. "}]
