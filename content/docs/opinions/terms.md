# The terms I will use

## Why be specific

Kombucha brewing has a great deal of associated mythology. While this provides some interesting reading and makes the brewing process feel magical, it can sometimes make it difficult for new brewers to undestand what they are reading online (at least it did for me).

Written communication only really works if we all understand what specific terms mean. This is doubly true for something like a recipe, since the writer is attempting to convey specific instructions. To make things clear at least on this site, I will summarize the terms I intend to use. I don't make any claim that these are the "correct" terms but they are the ones that make the most sense to me, and I will try to be consistent.

## Terms in use

Starter Liquid or Raw Kombucha
: Unflavored, unpasturized kombucha that has finished primary fermentation. This should be quite acidic and can be used to start the fermentation process in a new batch. This only refers to **liquid**.

Biofilm
: The cellulose layer that forms on top of fermenting Kombucha. This is sometimes referred to as a pellicle or SCOBY. But for clarity, I will use the narrowest term possible (biofilm). You can read more about biofilms on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm). This only refers to the **solid** cellulose layer.

## Terms I will not use

Pellicle
: This is a term commonly used to refer to the biofilm. It is somewhat specific, but does have other meanings in more scientific communities.

SCOBY
: Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast. This term came into use in the [late 1990s](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/scoby-kombucha-word-history) and is very overloaded in the Kombucha community. Some insist it refers only to the biofilm, others only to the starter liquid, some to both. To avoid this confusion, I will eschew its use entirely in favor of the more specific terms above.
