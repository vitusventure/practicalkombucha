# Basic simple syrup

A basic simple syrup that can be used to create an easy flavoring from fresh or frozen berries. I like using a syrup because it is easy to measure out and I find the bottles more attractive than using whole berries. If stored in the fridge, it should keep at least 2 weeks though could last much longer.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup white sugar
* 1 cup water
* 1.5 cups frozen or fresh berries

## Procedures

1. Add all ingredients to a sauce pan
2. Bring to a boil
3. Lower heat to simmer
4. Simmer 15 minutes (squish berries while simmering to release more **flavor**)
5. Strain into container, store in fridge

## Using to flavor

When bottling, add 1-3 Tbsp per 16oz depending on the level of fizz and flavor you are after (I usually am happy with 2 Tbsp)
