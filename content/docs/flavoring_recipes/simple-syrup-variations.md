# Simple Syrup Variations

Here are some different variations of the basic simple syrup recipe. These are specific formulations that I have had success with.

## Triple Berry Mix

Make the simple syrup using the frozen Triple Berry Mix (blueberry, blackberry, raspberry) available from most grocery stores. I used 1.5 cups frozen berries for a nice dark color and rich taste.

## Raspberry

Used 1.5 cups of frozen raspberries. Amazing color but the flavor was a bit less potent than expected. May try bumping to 2 cups next time.
