# Base Kombucha Recipe

This is a very basic kombucha recipe using easy to find ingredients. It should yield 1 gallon of finished kombucha.

Since you must retain 2 cups to start your next batch you will end with 14 cups finished kombucha for bottling (or about 7 16oz bottles).

## Ingredients

* 2 cups kombucha starter
* 4 cups sweet tea (see below)
* 10 cups cold water

## Procedures

### 1. Make sweet tea

1. In a sauce pan, bring 4 cups water to a boil.
2. Remove from heat, let cool until no longer boiling (1-2 min)
3. Add 6 Lipton (or any black tea) bags, let steep 6 minutes
4. Remove tea bags, mix in 1 cup sugar until dissolved
5. 4 cups sweet tea are now finished

### 2. Prepare fermenter

Wash a 1 gallon fermenter well with soap and hot water. Consider spraying with diluted StarSan solution for sanitization.

### 3. Mix Kombucha

1. Add 10 cups cold water to fermenter
2. Add 4 cups sweet tea to fermenter
3. Ensure diluted tea in fermenter is not too hot (I usually shoot for below 85 degrees)
4. Add 2 cups starter liquid

### 4. Ferment

1. Place tight woven cloth cover over fermenter opening, secure with rubber band.
    * This will allow air exchange, but will keep flies out
2. Place in a warm area or supply supplemental heat with a heat pad (generally shoot to ferment around 75-82 degrees F)
3. Allow to ferment until finished (about 7-10 days)

## Starting your next batch

Once fermentation is complete, reserve 2 cups of fermented kombucha as your starter for your next batch. Bottle the remaining fermented kombucha with flavoring.

You may discard the biofilm (or retain it if you want). See [Retaining the biofilm](/docs/opinions/retaining-the-biofilm) for more thoughts on that matter.
