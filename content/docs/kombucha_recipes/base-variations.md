# Base kombucha recipe variations

These are variations that can be applied to the base recipe for differing results.

## 1.125 gallon batch

The name is a bit pedantic, but the function is clear. Add an additional 2 cups of cold water to the base kombucha recipe. This will mean your batch is slightly over one gallon so be sure your fermenter is big enough! This will allow you to bottle a full gallon at the end of the batch and still have 2 cups left over to start your next batch.

If you are concerned about the strength of your starter you may want to avoid this variation. Adding some extra water will mean your ratio of starter is slightly lower. It has generally worked for me, but it adds a touch of risk!
