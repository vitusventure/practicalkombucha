# Dry Hopped Kombucha

Dry hopping is a process borrowed from beer brewing where hops are soaked in the fermenting/fermented beer to infuse the fruity and floral hop flavors without adding much bitterness. Think very hop forward beers like IPAs. This is in contrast to traditional hop additions to beer during boiling which add a large chunk of bitterness (this is useful to offset the very sweet wort).

I have found hops to be a delightful addition to kombucha. The floral characteristics really compliment kombucha's sourness and pair well with berry flavorings.

## Procedure

After 1f, transfer raw kombucha to be dry hopped to a fermenter. Add loose pellet hops of your chosen variety. I have used 1oz hops/1 gallon kombucha with great success, though that variable is ripe for experimentation.

Let the hops soak in the kombucha 2-3 days. Consider stirring occasionally as the hops will break up and float on the surface.

Strain out the hops, then proceed to standard 2f in bottles with flavoring/sweetener.
