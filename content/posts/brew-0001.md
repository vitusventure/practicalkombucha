This was the first brew after pausing for about a year. Used 16oz of starter that had been kept in the fridge since my last brew.

## Fermentation and bottling

1F:
* Fermented 8 days
* Final pH 2.5
* Nicely tart

2F:
* Bottled 2 16oz bottles with 2tbsp/16oz Triple Berry Simple Syrup
* Initially carbonated 2 days, but was a bit flat. Took out for 1 more day and got good fizz.

Dry hopping:
* Dry hopped 1/2 gallon in a large mason jar with .5oz Cashmere hops
  * Hops in pellet form, added loose
* Let dry hop 3 days, then bottled with 2tbsp/16oz Triple Berry Simple Syrup
* Let carbonate 3 days

# Tasting notes

The non-dry hopped kombucha came out great. Ended up a bit less tart than I usually like, but that may be a result of slightly slower fermentation due to old starter.

The dry hopped kombucha was excellent. Slightly floral without being overpowering, the hops added a nice taste. Certainly will try again!
