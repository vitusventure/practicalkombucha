## 1f

Seemed to be a bit of a slow ferment. Didn't form much of a biofilm, more like a few floating patches than one large mass. Could be attributed to more fermenter motion since it is tucked away a bit now. Still got nicely acidic, ending pH around 2.5

## 2f

Bottled 7 16oz. 4 Raspberry syrup, 3 Triple Berry syrup.

Did a somewhat continuous approach to next batch. Drained 14 cups from fermenter for bottling, leaving ~4 cups behind. Added 14 cups sweetened white tea to start batch 5.
