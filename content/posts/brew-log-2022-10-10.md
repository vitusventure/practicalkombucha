Finished 1.5 days of dry hopping today in 1/2 gallon jar. Total yield was a little over 7 cups, lost about 1 cup to the hops (strained through cheese cloth and squeezed).

Transfered to 16oz bottles with Simple Syrup 1. One bottle required topping up with regular water due to loss to hops.

Was going to do one bottle without any flavoring, but forgot to make a sugar syrup for carbonation.

Moved 4 bottles to 2F chamber. Moved 2 bottles out to fridge (after 36hrs carbonation). Carbonation seemed good (wanted to push out stoppers).
