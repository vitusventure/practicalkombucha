# Keep it practical

Kombucha is a tasty drink that is easy to make at home. However, it generally has a great deal of mythology and mysticism associated with its creation which can make it difficult to get down to the facts.

This site is a collection of my thoughts on brewing kombucha at home and an attempt to cut just to the practical details. Skip the magic and get right to the beverage that you grow yourself!

So we are all on the same page, you might want to take a look at the [terms](/docs/opinions/terms) I use on the site.
