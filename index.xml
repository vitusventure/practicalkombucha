Total yield was a little over 7 cups, lost about 1 cup to the hops (strained through cheese cloth and squeezed).
Transfered to 16oz bottles with Simple Syrup 1. One bottle required topping up with regular water due to loss to hops.
Was going to do one bottle without any flavoring, but forgot to make a sugar syrup for carbonation.</description></item><item><title>Finishing first 1F in a year</title><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/posts/brew-log-2022-10-08/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/posts/brew-log-2022-10-08/</guid><description>1F from year old starter finished toda after 8 days fermeting (Base Kombucha Recipe).

It should yield 1 gallon of finished Kombucha.
Since you must retain 2 cups to start your next batch you will end with 14 cups finished Kombucha for bottling (or about 7 16oz bottles).
Ingredients # 2 cups Kombucha starter 4 cups sweet tea (see below) 10 cups cold water Procedures # 1. Make sweet tea # In a sauce pan, bring 4 cups water to a boil.</description></item><item><title>Basic Simple Syrup</title><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/flavoring_recipes/basic-simple-syrup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/flavoring_recipes/basic-simple-syrup/</guid><description>some test content</description></item><item><title>Kombucha Recipe Variations</title><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/kombucha_recipes/kombucha-recipe-variations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/kombucha_recipes/kombucha-recipe-variations/</guid><description>Variations on the base Kombucha recipe # These are variations that can be applied to the base recipe for differing results. They can generally be mixed and matched.
1.125 gallon batch # The name is a bit pedantic, but the function is clear. Add an additional 2 cups of cold water to the base kombucha recipe. This will mean your batch is slightly over one gallon so be sure your fermenter is big enough!</description></item><item><title>Retaining the biofilm</title><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/opinions/retaining-the-biofilm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/opinions/retaining-the-biofilm/</guid><description> Should you retain the biofilm? #</description></item><item><title>Terms I will use</title><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/opinions/terms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/opinions/terms/</guid><description>The terms I will use # Why be specific # Kombucha brewing has a great deal of associated mythology. While this provides some interesting reading and makes the brewing process feel magical, it can sometimes make it difficult for new brewers to undestand what they are reading online (at least it did for me).
Written communication only really works if we all understand what specific terms mean. This is doubly true for something like a recipe, since the writer is attempting to convey specific instructions.</description></item></channel></rss>
