Think very hop forward beers like IPAs. This is in contrast to traditional hop additions to beer during boiling which add a large chunk of bitterness (this is useful to offset the very sweet wort).
I have found hops to be a delightful addition to kombucha.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/flavoring_recipes/simple-syrup-variations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/flavoring_recipes/simple-syrup-variations/</guid><description>Simple Syrup Variations # Here are some different variations of the basic simple syrup recipe. These are specific formulations that I have had success with.
Triple Berry Mix # Make the simple syrup using the frozen Triple Berry Mix (blueberry, blackberry, raspberry) available from most grocery stores. I used 1.5 cups frozen berries for a nice dark color and rich taste.
Raspberry # Used 1.5 cups of frozen raspberries. Amazing color but the flavor was a bit less potent than expected.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/kombucha_recipes/base-kombucha-recipe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/kombucha_recipes/base-kombucha-recipe/</guid><description>Base Kombucha Recipe # This is a very basic kombucha recipe using easy to find ingredients. It should yield 1 gallon of finished kombucha.
Since you must retain 2 cups to start your next batch you will end with 14 cups finished kombucha for bottling (or about 7 16oz bottles).
Ingredients # 2 cups kombucha starter 4 cups sweet tea (see below) 10 cups cold water Procedures # 1. Make sweet tea # In a sauce pan, bring 4 cups water to a boil.</description></item><item><title>Base recipe variations</title><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/kombucha_recipes/base-variations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/kombucha_recipes/base-variations/</guid><description>Base kombucha recipe variations # These are variations that can be applied to the base recipe for differing results.
1.125 gallon batch # The name is a bit pedantic, but the function is clear. Add an additional 2 cups of cold water to the base kombucha recipe. This will mean your batch is slightly over one gallon so be sure your fermenter is big enough! This will allow you to bottle a full gallon at the end of the batch and still have 2 cups left over to start your next batch.</description></item><item><title>Basic Simple Syrup</title><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/flavoring_recipes/basic-simple-syrup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/flavoring_recipes/basic-simple-syrup/</guid><description>Basic simple syrup # A basic simple syrup that can be used to create an easy flavoring from fresh or frozen berries. I like using a syrup because it is easy to measure out and I find the bottles more attractive than using whole berries. If stored in the fridge, it should keep at least 2 weeks though could last much longer.
Ingredients # 1 cup white sugar 1 cup water 1.</description></item><item><title>Retaining the biofilm</title><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/opinions/retaining-the-biofilm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/opinions/retaining-the-biofilm/</guid><description>TLDR: Should you retain the biofilm? # It isn&amp;rsquo;t required, but it won&amp;rsquo;t hurt anything.
What is the biofilm? # Sometimes called the pellicle or the SCOBY, the biofilm is one of the things that really make kombucha stand out. It is the rubbery disk that develops during fermentation. Some are adamant that it must be kept from batch to batch, going so far as to wash and cut it down.</description></item><item><title>Terminology</title><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/opinions/terms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/opinions/terms/</guid><description>Terminology # Why be specific # Kombucha brewing has a great deal of associated mythology. While this provides some interesting reading and makes the brewing process feel magical, it can sometimes make it difficult for new brewers to understand what they are reading online (at least it did for me).
Written communication only really works if we all understand what specific terms mean. This is doubly true for something like a recipe, since the writer is attempting to convey specific instructions.</description></item></channel></rss>
