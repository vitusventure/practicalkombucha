Used 16oz of starter that had been kept in the fridge since my last brew.
Fermentation and bottling # 1F:

Bottled 2 16oz bottles with 2tbsp/16oz Triple Berry Simple Syrup Initially carbonated 2 days, but was a bit flat. Took out for 1 more day and got good fizz.

It should yield 1 gallon of finished Kombucha.
Since you must retain 2 cups to start your next batch you will end with 14 cups finished Kombucha for bottling (or about 7 16oz bottles).
Ingredients # 2 cups Kombucha starter 4 cups sweet tea (see below) 10 cups cold water Procedures # 1. Make sweet tea # In a sauce pan, bring 4 cups water to a boil.</description></item><item><title>Basic Simple Syrup</title><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/flavoring_recipes/basic-simple-syrup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/flavoring_recipes/basic-simple-syrup/</guid><description>Basic simple syrup # A basic simple syrup that can be used to create an easy flavoring from fresh or frozen berries. I like using a syrup because it is easy to measure out and I find the bottles more attractive than using whole berries. If stored in the fridge, it should keep at least 2 weeks though could last much longer.
Ingredients # 1 cup white sugar 1 cup water 1.</description></item><item><title>Kombucha Recipe Variations</title><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/kombucha_recipes/kombucha-recipe-variations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/kombucha_recipes/kombucha-recipe-variations/</guid><description>Variations on the base Kombucha recipe # These are variations that can be applied to the base recipe for differing results. They can generally be mixed and matched.
1.125 gallon batch # The name is a bit pedantic, but the function is clear. Add an additional 2 cups of cold water to the base kombucha recipe. This will mean your batch is slightly over one gallon so be sure your fermenter is big enough!</description></item><item><title>Retaining the biofilm</title><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/opinions/retaining-the-biofilm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/opinions/retaining-the-biofilm/</guid><description> Should you retain the biofilm? #</description></item><item><title>Terminology</title><link>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/opinions/terms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://practicalkombucha.com/docs/opinions/terms/</guid><description>Terminology # Why be specific # Kombucha brewing has a great deal of associated mythology. While this provides some interesting reading and makes the brewing process feel magical, it can sometimes make it difficult for new brewers to understand what they are reading online (at least it did for me).
Written communication only really works if we all understand what specific terms mean. This is doubly true for something like a recipe, since the writer is attempting to convey specific instructions.</description></item></channel></rss>
